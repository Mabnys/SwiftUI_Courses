## SwiftUI Tutorial: Navigation
- In this tutorial, you’ll use SwiftUI to implement the navigation of a master-detail app.
- In addition you will learn more about managing the flow of data in your app using property wrappers:
- [x] *@State*,
- [x] *@Binding*,
- [x] *@ObservedObject*,
- [x] *@EnvironmentObjects* etc.
- You’ll learn how to implement a navigation stack, a navigation bar button, a context menu and a modal sheet. By [Fabrizio Brancati]().


## SwiftUI View Modifiers Tutorial for iOS
- In this tutorial, you'll learn how to refactor your code to create powerful custom SwiftUI view modifiers.
- In this tutorial, you’ll use an app called **AdoptAPet**, a simple master-detail view app, meaning there is a master view that shows high-level information, in this case an adoptable furry friend’s picture and name, and then a detail view that displays when the user taps a list row.
- You’ll refactor AdoptAPet as you learn how to use SwiftUI’s *ViewModifier* protocol for:
- [x] Creating custom view modifiers.
- [x] Building new **button styles**.
- [x] Creating modifiers with **conditional parameters**.
- [x] **Extending views** to create reusable components.
- You’ll learn how to make your views look consistent and your code easier to read and maintain. By [Danijela Vrzan]().
